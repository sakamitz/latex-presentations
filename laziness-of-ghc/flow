laziness -> non-strictness
bottom -> halting problem -> staticly determine -> dependent type
outside-in -> WHNF

thunk -> CAF
actual value -> differ unboxed & boxed

without O2

ret type -> D# -> heap checking
unbox -> register

what can be further optimized

seq -> keep it in outermost -> force
seq -> pseq
